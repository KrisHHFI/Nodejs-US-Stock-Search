### About

- The app was created in January 2023. It enables the user to search for stock tickers and recieve basic company data. The results are then maintained within a table.
- The tickers which can be found are those which are accesible via Polygon.io API "Ticker Details v3". Searchable tickers are mainly medium or large cap US companies.
- If you make "Too Many Requests" (add more than 5 tickers within 1 minutes), then just wait 1 minute.
- The app shows end of day market data.
- Please do not make any financial decisions, based upon the data found here.
- App functionality may be affected by future changes to Polygon.io or Node.js.
